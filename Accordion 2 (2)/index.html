          Accordions should be used when there are multiple sections of content,
          and the user needs to quickly access and understand specific
          information. They can be used to organize information in a way that is
          easy to scan and read, making it easier for users to find what they
          need.

          An accordion is a vertically stacked list of headers that can be
          expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide the content associated with
          each header.

          If a user clicks on a collapsed card while another card is open, there
          are two approaches that can be taken: the open card can be closed and
          the new card opened, or the new card can be opened while the old one
          remains open.

          Icons can be used to indicate the state of an accordion, such as a
          plus sign (+) to indicate that the section is collapsed, and a minus
          sign (-) to indicate that the section is expanded. Other icons can
          also be used, such as a caret or a triangle.
