              Some days a motivational quote can provide a quick pick-me-up for
              employees and even management. They can be a breath of fresh air
              when it comes to a drab afternoon.

              If you find yourself doing the same routine day after day, never
              remembering what you did the day before, having nothing to look
              forward to, living your life - but never enjoying it or anything.

              Large businesses require a lot of IT infrastructure and a
              department to look after it. Small businesses often can't afford
              to have that sort of internal support in place, yet they need
              fully operational IT systems in order for.
